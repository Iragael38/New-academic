Circular Economy has gained attention from researchers, industrials and policymakers, as it is a solution for sustainability problems. It aims to keep products, components and materials at their highest value by closing material and energy loops. In this context, digital technologies are seen as a solution for its implementation. However, while the use of digital technologies in industry is growing, the issue of how they support Circular Economy is not widely explored. 

Therefore, the results of the first master thesis lead to a conceptualization of Circular Economy based of the use of Business Model Canvas literature. The functionalities of digital technologies and their roles to support Circular Economy were also overviewed. Based on a literature review and six case studies from secondary sources, the study found that the main roles of digital technologies are the enabler and trigger ones, linked these roles with Business Model Canvas elements that are defined according to R-principles such as reuse, remanufacture, recycle and identified the functionalities of digital technologies that enable these roles
