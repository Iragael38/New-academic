abstract= "Circular Economy (CE) is an economic system that closes material and energy loops in production and consumption systems. In this context, digital technologies (DT) are seen as solutions for Circular Economy implementation. However, while the use of digital technologies in industry is growing, their specific effect on Circular Economy is not widely explored. Hence, this paper aims to identify the roles of digital technologies supporting Circular Economy. Based on a literature review as well as three case studies, we proposed to evaluate the relationship between Circular Economy and digital technologies by using Business Model Canvas integrating the R-principles such as reuse, remanufacture and recycle."
